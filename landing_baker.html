<h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
<p>This project investigated the relationship between latitude and different weather factors.
    Data were pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API for 5?? cities on 21/24 June 2021.
</p>
<p>
    Matplotlib was used to create visualizations of the relationships between different factors in the data.
    Specifically, this site looks at the relationships between latitude and four other variables: temperature,
    humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
